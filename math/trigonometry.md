   c

a - hypotenuse
b - opposite
c - adjacent

sine = opposite/hypotenuse
cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse

sine and cosine fit in a circle, if hypotenuse stays as 1, alter the angle 

tangent
cotangent

unit circle


distance to infinite height (tangent) is always unit circle width 1

infinite width ceiling
cosecant (hypotenuse)
cotangent (adjacent)



imagine:
- a dome
- a screen
- a wall (on the right side of the dome)
- a ceiling (on top of the dome)


dome (sine/cosine)
you are in the middle of the dome
sine = screen height (top is where you hang the screen, opposite side)
cosine = screen distance (distance from center to screen, adjacent side)
hypotenuse = 1 ()
angle is x, x changes then the sine and cosine values will change but not the hypotenuse
sine = opposite/hypotenuse
cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse
x = 0, means screen has 0 height
x = 90, means screen has 0 distance from the center

trig values are percentages, 100% to 0% to -100%
divide current value by the maximum possible value (radius of the dome, hypotenuse, the 
hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangles).

every circle is the unit circle just scaled differently

imagine a wall at distance = 1 of the unit circle
secant is the hypotenuse
tangent is the size of the wall (opposite/adjacent)
secant is the length of the hypotenuse to the wall (hypotenuse/adjacent)


imagine a ceiling on top of the dome
adjacent (sine) is the height of the circle
cosecant is the hypotenuse
cotangent is the the width (length ceiling extends)



a cable makes a 39 degree angle with the seabed
the cable is 30 meters long
d is the opposite side, want to know the distance
sin 39 degrees = d / 30
0.6293 = d /30
d = 0.6293 * 30
d = 18.88 m
d is 18.88


A and B are on one side of a river, 100 feet apart
C is on the opposite side.
A angle is 70
B angle is 60


Secant Function:
	  	sec(θ) = Hypotenuse / Adjacent 	  	(=1/cos)
Cosecant Function:
	  	csc(θ) = Hypotenuse / Opposite 	  	(=1/sin)
Cotangent Function:
	  	cot(θ) = Adjacent / Opposite 	  	(=1/tan)










length up a hill

500 m high hill
incline of 12 degres

500/h = sin(12)
500/sin(12) = 2400 m



depth to a bed of coal

tilted 12 degrees down
6 km from house
want to know opposite

hypotenuse = 6km
tan(12) = opposite/6km
0.213 * 5 = 1.275 km


Calculate Angle

colorado river drop 3200 feet at lake mead
 to 500 feet at Lee's Ferry, 
 river is 270 miles
 
2700 to 0 (hypotenuse), (2700 / 5280 feet) = 0.511 miles
270 opposite

0.511/270 = 0.00189 = sin(x)
take the inverse sine of each
(sin^(-1)(sin(x)) = sin^(-1)(0.00189)
x = 0.11 degrees

angle of pile
11 cm high, radius of 16 cm
16 cm is adjacent
11 cm is opposite
tan(x) = 11/16
.6875
tan^(-1)(11/16) = 34.5


sin takes an angle and gives us a ratio
sin-1 takes  a ratio and gives and angle


angle of elevation for a plane from A on the ground
to B in the sky (300 feet high, 400 feet away)
opposite/adjacent = tan(x)
300/400= 0.75
tan-1 0.75 = 36.9


distance is 6750
hypotenuse (slope) is 8100
cosine
6750/8100= 0.833
then use cos-1 (0.8333)
33.6 degrees
