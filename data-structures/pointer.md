# Pointer

A programming language object whose value referes to (points to) another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its memory address. A pointer ferences a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferening the pointer. 

Analogy: a page number in a book's index is a pointer to a corresponding page, dereferencing such a pointer is done by turning to the page with the given number.

Pointers to data significantly improve peroframnce for repetitive operations like traversing strings, lookup tables, control tables and tree structures. It is often cheaper in time and space to copy and dereference pointers than it is to copy and access the data to which the pointers point.

## Formal

A pointer is a kind of reference.

A data primitive is any datum that can be read from or written to computer memory using one memory access (bytes, words).

A data aggregate is a group of primitvies that are logically contiguous in memory and are viewed collectively as one datum.

A byte is the smallest primiteve, each memory address specifices a different byte. 

A memory pointer is a primitive the value of which is intended to be used as a memory address. Pointers point to memory addresses.

## Data structures

Start pointers
End pointers
Stack pointers
Absolute - the actual physical address or virtual address
Relative - an offset of a start address
