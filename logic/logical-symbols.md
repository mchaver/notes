Common Logical Symbols

∧ is a wedge. Latex: `\wedge`

 - Logical conjunction.

& is an ampersand. Latex: \ampersand

 - Logical conjunction. 

∨ is vel or descending wedge. Latex: `\vee` or `\lor`

 - Logical disjunction, or.

¬ negation.

~ negation.

→ implication. Latex: `\to` and `\rightarrow` 

 - if then

⇒ material implication. Latex: `\Rightarrow` and `\implies`

≡ if and only if, iff. Latex: `\iff`

| Sheffer stroke, NAND. Latex: `\nand`
	
∀ Universal Quantification, for all. `\forall`
  
  - For all natural numbers $P(n)$ holds, where $P(n)$ is some predicate. $\forall n \in \mathbb{N} P(n)$

∃ Existential Quantification. Latex: `\exists`

 - There exists, there is at least one. For at least one natural number, there exists some natural number where the predicate $P(n)$ is true. Let $P(a)$ be $a < 5$. $\exists n \in \mathbb{N} P(n)$ 
	
⊤ tautology. Latex: `\top`
 
 - True in every possible interpretation.
	
⊥ bottom, contradiction. Latex: `\bot`


⊢ is a turnstile. Latex: `\vdash`
 
 - Judgement. I know $A$ is true, $\vdash A$.
 - Conditional Assertion. From $P$, I know that $Q$, $P \vdash Q$.
 - Syntactic Consequence or Derivability. One thing can be derived from another in a single step. Q is derivable from P, $P \vdash Q$. $Q$ is a theorem in the system, $\vdash Q$.

⊨ is a double turnstile. Latex: \vDash and \models. 

 - Semantic Consequence. If every sentence on the left is true, then the sentence on the right must be true, $\Gamma \vDash \gamma$. Related to Syntactice Consequence.
 - Satisfaction. The structure is a model for teh set of sentences, $A \vDash \Gamma$
 - Tautology. The expression $\gamma$ is a semantic consequence of the empty set, $\vDash \gamma$. 

∴ therefore sign. Latex: `\therefore`

 - Logical Consequence. $x + 1 = 6 \therefore x = 5$
